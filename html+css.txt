HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
	For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
	In short, we can specify the layout and structure of our website using html.

<h_i>____</h_i> -- is heading command. As i increases size of text goes down. i=6 is minimum possible heading size.
					beyond i=6 it doesn't  change size of text.

HTML anatomy = An element in html contains of opening tag and closing tag and content. 
			   There are some elements which are self closing. e.g. <br>, <hr>
			   <p>--</p>, <h_i>--</ h_i> are not self closing. Opening element is name of element within angle brackets.
			   Closing element is same as opening but additionally contians '/' inside angle brackets.

Attributes = html elements can also have one or more attributes associated with them. Attributes contians more info about element.
			e.g. <hr size="3" noshade>.

<head> = The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
		Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
		Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
		The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
