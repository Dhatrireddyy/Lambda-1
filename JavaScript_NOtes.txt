Java is compiled while Js is interpreted. 
typeof - gives type of given datatype.
alert() - takes string as input and gives alert on browser with given string as alert massege.
prompt() - takes input from browser.

Fixed values are called Literals.  (let)
Variable values are called Variables. (var)
Constant values are constants. (const)

var - can be updated/redeclared. Can be declared without initialization. Have functional scope. 
let - can be updated but cannot redeclared. Can be declared without initialization. Have block scope.
const - cannot be updated and cannot redeclared. Cannot be declared without initialization. Have block scope.

string concatenation - + between two strings concatenate them. e.g. 'pradeep' + ' ' + 'mundlik'
str.length = gives length of string.
str.slice(x,y)  = gives chars with index from x to y-1. 
str.toUpperCase = makes all chars of string to upper case. 
str.toLowerCase = makes all chars of string to lower case. 

x++ = increment
x-- = decrement
can also use +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.

function keyword is used to declare a function.

math.random() = returns number between 0.00000000 to 0.9999999999.

=== used to check equality.
!== not equal to.
<, >, <=, >=

Note: In js, 3 === '3' is false but 3 == '3' is true. 


a = []
a.length  = length of array. 
a.includes(b) = checks if b is in a or not.


for and while loops are similar to c. 


Document object modification (DOM):
There is tree of document. HTML is first element and further html head and html body....so on.
We can manipulate them in js using some commmands. 
e.g. document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild, etc.  

html objects has some properties and some methods associated with them. 
We can use them using js. 
e.g. button has prroperties like innerHTML, style, firstChild and methods like click(), appendChild(), setAttributes().

document.getElementsByTagName('') - returns array of all html elements in document with given tag name. 
document.getElementsByClassName('') - returns array of all html elements in document with given class name. 
document.getElementById('') - returns an element with given id. 

document.querySelector() - It returns an unique element. For tag use it directly. For id use # and for class name use .
e.g. document.querySelector("h1") , document.querySelector("#title") , document.querySelector(".btn") . 

We can meintion hiearchy in querySelector by spaces. 
document.querySelector("#list a") - will give an element with anchor tag inside element with id list. 

document.querySelector('button').classList.add('invisible') - adding class invisible to class list of button. 

document.querySelector('a').attributes
document.querySelector('a').getAttribute('')
document.querySelector('a').setAttribute('','')
